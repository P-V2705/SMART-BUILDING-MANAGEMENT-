Abstract
The Smart Building Management System (SBMS) is designed to optimize building operations by integrating automation, IoT sensors, and real-time data analytics. This final phase delivers a seamless system for controlling HVAC, lighting, security, and energy consumption through a centralized interface. The project demonstrates AI-based decision-making, environmental adaptation, and predictive maintenance features. This document outlines the entire system lifecycle, including demonstration insights, architecture diagrams, performance data, source code documentation, and testing evaluations. The SBMS ensures efficiency, scalability, and enhanced occupant experience in modern infrastructure.
